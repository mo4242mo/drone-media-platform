# Drone Media Sharing Platform — PPT Script (English)

## Design and Scalability Overview

## (Generated from Markdown)

# Problem Definition

##  

## •     A cloud-native platform for drone pilots and teams to ingest, manage, search, collaborate on, and distribute drone media (photos, videos, audio) with rich geospatial metadata.

## •     Audience: hobbyists, professional pilots, inspection teams, emergency response units.

## •     Media types: high-resolution photos (RAW/JPEG), 4K/8K videos, 360° footage, live streams, mission audio.

## •     Metadata: GPS coordinates, altitude, heading, speed, sensor data, timestamps, camera params.

## •     Workflows: mission planning and capture → upload/stream → processing/indexing → review/annotation → share/publish.

## •     Core challenges: bursty uploads; heavy compute for transcoding/indexing; large storage footprint; low-latency viewing; compliance/privacy.

## •     Value proposition: centralized asset catalog, fast discovery, secure sharing, collaboration, and analytics.

# Scalability and the appropriateness of using cloud architecture

##  

## •     Cloud is well‑suited to unpredictable workloads and heavy media processing with elastic scaling and global delivery.

## •     Elastic compute for transcoding, thumbnailing, AI enrichment; scale out on demand.

## •     Object storage for massive, durable, cost‑optimized media; lifecycle policies for tiering.

## •     Event-driven pipelines decouple producers and consumers; handle bursts gracefully.

## •     Global CDN reduces latency for playback and previews; edge caching saves bandwidth.

## •     Pay‑as‑you‑go model aligns cost with usage peaks (missions, events, crises).

## •     Managed services reduce undifferentiated heavy lifting; focus on product features.

# Chosen cloud model

##  

## •     Microservices with event‑driven communication, combined with serverless components for elasticity.

## •     Services: Identity & Access, Flight Management, Media Ingest/Processing, Catalog/Metadata, Search/Discovery, Distribution/Streaming, Compliance & Audit.

## •     Event bus connects services via domain events (uploaded, processed, indexed, flagged).

## •     Independent scaling per service (e.g., processing vs. playback) reduces contention.

## •     Polyglot tech stack per service: video pipelines, geospatial search, real‑time messaging.

## •     Alternative models considered: monolith (simpler, inflexible), N‑tier (higher coupling), pure serverless (workflow complexity). Final: microservices + serverless for balance.

# Domain Driven Analysis

##  

## •     Bounded contexts and entities derived from drone media domain.

## •     Entities: User/Org, Drone Device, Mission/Flight, Media Asset, Metadata (geo/sensor), Comments/Likes, Share/ACL, Compliance Record.

## •     Bounded contexts: Identity & Access; Flight Management; Media Ingest; Media Processing & Catalog; Search & Discovery; Streaming; Compliance & Audit.

## •     Ubiquitous language: mission, waypoint, asset, catalog, index, stream, compliance flag.

## •     Aggregates: Mission (flights/assets), Asset (derivatives/metadata), Policy (rules/compliance).

## •     Domain events: AssetUploaded, AssetProcessed, IndexUpdated, ComplianceFlagged, ShareGranted.

# Architecture diagram

# Architecture explanation

##  

## •     From upload to playback, an event‑driven pipeline orchestrates processing, indexing, compliance, and distribution.

## •     Ingestion: Clients upload media or push live streams via Front Door/CDN; front‑end is served by Static Web Apps.

## •     Authentication: Microsoft Entra ID provides SSO/MFA and issues tokens for secure API calls.

## •     Media processing: Media Service validates files, generates proxies/thumbnails, transcodes for HLS/DASH; writes assets to Blob.

## •     Cataloging: Catalog Service stores descriptive and technical metadata in Cosmos DB; links to missions and access controls.

## •     Indexing: Search Service consumes processing events, enriches assets (text/labels/geo), updates Cognitive Search indexes.

## •     Compliance: Compliance Service checks geofencing, privacy rules, retention policies; records audit trails and flags.

## •     Distribution: CDN serves on‑demand streams and previews; SignalR delivers real‑time collaboration notifications.

# Assessment of limitations

##  

## •     Architectural complexity: microservices + events require governance, tracing, and robust DevOps.

## •     Cost & bandwidth pressure: storage and egress can be significant; optimize with tiers and caching.

## •     Latency: processing/indexing introduces delays; careful separation of real‑time vs. offline paths is vital.

## •     Compliance & privacy: regional regulations vary; enforce fine‑grained access and retention policies.

## •     Device heterogeneity: diverse codecs/bitrates/containers need transcoding and compatibility handling.

# Evaluation of scalability

##  

## •     Strengths

## •     Weaknesses

## •     Mitigations

## •     Serverless + event‑driven design adapts to peaks and troughs automatically.

## •     Independent scaling for ingest, processing, search, and distribution avoids bottlenecks.

## •     CDN/object storage support high read concurrency; indexes accelerate discovery.

## •     Cross‑service topology increases failure domains and debugging difficulty.

## •     Transcoding/AI inference can choke at extreme peaks without capacity planning.

## •     Live streaming demands end‑to‑end tuning across network and regions.

## •     Prioritize hot paths: dedicated pools and auto‑scale for upload, preview, live.

## •     Workload tiering: separate real‑time and batch pipelines; implement backpressure.

## •     Cost controls: storage lifecycle, proxy streams, thumbnails/low‑res previews by default.
